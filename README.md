System Design Playbook

This repository is my personal journey into system design and high-level architecture. It documents everything I learn â€” from core concepts to real-world case studies â€” and includes my own diagrams, explanations, and hands-on projects.

ðŸ“Œ What youâ€™ll find here:

Notes: Scalable system design fundamentals (databases, caching, load balancing, etc.)

Case Studies: Architecture breakdowns of systems like WhatsApp, Uber, Instagram, URL shorteners

Diagrams: Visual representations of system components and workflows

Projects: Mini prototypes (Spring Boot + Angular + SQL) applying design concepts

ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Turn knowledge into practice â†’ by the end, this repo evolves into a portfolio of my system design skills.
